# The Importance of a Solid README.md

## Why Create a README

* Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your identity as a developer. Having works on display is a vital way to show your work off to other developers and especially employees. Something many newer developers will overlook is the `README.md`

* The `README` of a project can differentiate a good project from a bad project. It gives you an opportunity to talk about your application, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some challenges faced or future features you hope to implement. A good README will help you stand out in a large crowd of developers putting work on GitHub.

### How to Create a README

* We write our READMEs using Markdown. Here is a cheat-sheet so you can start looking over the syntax. [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

* We have also provided you a template for a solid README start for your works. You can simply read over the structure, and fill it out to fit your project!
